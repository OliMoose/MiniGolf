# MiniGolf
This is a Discord MiniGolf bot, made for the Discord Hack Week.

I started writing as soon as the week started, but put it up on github at the end of Day 1- that's why the first few commits were so fast!

Invite: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591663049916678172&permissions=314432&scope=bot

To localhost it (if you need to) just replace 'token' with a bot token in ./data/token.json :)


Dependencies:
discord.py library,
aiohttp,
shapely,
PIL (Python Image Library),
numpy,
humanize

- and a bunch of other inbuilt modules
